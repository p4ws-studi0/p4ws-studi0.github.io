Even if the poop is not from the pet you were walking, it is imperative to remove the feces ASAP. Poop must be disposed in one of the garbage-bag-lined galvanized can with a tight fitting lid. The lid MUST remain on the can at all times to prevent dogs and flies from accessing it. Stool can contain viruses, bacteria, parasites, diseases like Giardia, and more. Rememeber, saftey first! Any abnormal stool (blood, diarrhea, loose, mucus, and stool with foreign bodies in it) should be brought to the attention of a manager immediately. There should always be one poop scoop set, a bucket, and steel can per fenced-in area. If any poop scoops need to be replaced, please let a manager know.

Start with a clean sink and drying basin. Sanitize the sink with 256 and rinse. Discard any remaining food and stack bowls according to size. Plug the drain to allow water to collect in the wash basin. Do not plug the basin used for drying. Add a splash of soapy water between the bowls to help dissolve solids. Soap the sponge and use hot water with a low flow rate and wash both sides and all surfaces. Leave dish water in the sink for soaking bowls as they are collected. Do not drain the sink until clean bowls are put into the drying basin. After dishes have been washed, rinse with a higher flow rate and place in the second basin to drip dry. Stack in such a way as to ensure they are able to drip dry. Dry with dish towels and stack according to size on the metal cart. Water bowls on the bottom, food bowls on the top shelf according to size. Cat and mini mansion water bowls are stored in the cat room cabinets and on the top of the mini mansions. Using the Dishwasher Visually check the drain cover to make sure there is no food residue. If there is any food residue, take the cover out and clean it before starting the dishwasher. Lightly rinse bowls with water and use a sponge to get any food residue from them before you put them in the dishwasher. Put a few drops of rinse aid in the bottom of the dishwasher each time you use the dishwasher. Run dishwasher cycle When finished, remove the bowls and inspect. If clean, dry and stack in the kitchen. If still dirty, hand wash before stacking in kitchen."

    "content": "Daycare and Boarding Lunches Gourmet Treats Daycare and Boarding Lunches & Gourmet Treats Operating Procedure Boarding Lunches and Gourmet Treats: Boarding lunches and gourmet treats should only be printed and prepared at lunch time, so we have the most up-to-date feeding info. In Gingr, start by accessing the “Feeding Report” under the Reports section. First, only select “Lunch” then select “Show animals without feeding info”, and deselect “Only show animals currently checked in,” to make sure it matches the image below. Also, put the report in room number alphabetical order by clicking “Lodging”! Press “Get PDF,” and print two copies. Highlight the feeds on both copies that will be made in the kitchen. Cut up one copy of the feeds (only the highlighted ones need to be cut) Prepare lunches and sign off once done. Note: if you cannot find a dog's food but they are currently checked in, the food is probably in the hallway, as they are leaving today. Conversely, a dog's lunch might still be in their bag up front, if they recently arrived. Please triple-check to make sure all dogs are fed correctly. Gourmet Treats In Gingr, start by accessing the “Services By Date” report under the Reports section. Under the “Services” section, select any option that has Gold, Silver, and Puppy. Then press “Scheduled Within Date Range.” Don’t forget to put the report in alphabetical order by lodging name by clicking “Lodging”! Print up one copy, and prepare the gourmet treats. How to prepare and deliver gourmet treats: Gourmet treats should be about 1-2 tablespoons per dog. Cats get a few shreds of house chicken as their gourmet treat. Mixed mashed potato mix, frozen vegetables, a small amount of chicken, and water in a large tupperware bowl with a lid. The consistency should be a good balance between not being runny, but not being too thick. Gather clean small bowls and the lunch feeding cart (boarding lunches and gourmet treats should be handed out together) When handing out gourmet treats, put the gourmet treat in the pet's existing food bowl in their room. If there is no pre-existing food bowl, put the gourmet treat in one of the new, small bowls. Lunchtime Medications: While it is rare a pet will need medications administered during lunchtime, it is still important to check the medication during lunchtime every day. On the left hand side menu on Gingr, navigate to 'Reports & More' > 'Reports' > 'Medication Report'. Under 'Medication Schedule', filter by 'Lunch' to see if there are any lunch medications. If there are any lunchtime medications, print up a copy and ensure the medication is administered. Don't forget to sign off once medication is administered. Daycare Lunches: Daycare lunches are typically kept outside of a pet's room in their basket. Check the refrigerator and freezer thoroughly to see if there are any daycare lunches. Check all the daycare bags in the hallway to see if there is any food in them. Sometimes, there will be food that we should not give the pet but the owner packed anyway, so please ask reception if there is any question. Gather a sufficient stack of medium-sized bowls. Walk and feed dogs their lunches in ALL AREAS, starting with Outside East, checking every single room to see if there is food outside their room. On really busy days, there may be daycare dogs in North. Ensure the North dogs are fed lunch. Check underneath room cards and in the dog's bag if they brought one in to ensure all food is given to the pet. If the pet brings in a small bag of treats, give ALL OF THEM to the pet during lunch time - if the pet brings in a big bag, give a reasonable amount. Double check all areas to ensure each and every lunch was given."

    "title": "Taking and Sending Pictures",
    "url": "/kb/petcare-procedures/Taking_and_Sending_Pictures.html",
    "content": "Taking and Sending Pictures Taking and Sending Pictures Operating Procedure This procedure will ensure great pictures are taken and sent efficiently and accurately. Why are great pictures important? Customers love to receive pictures of their dogs and cats! Pictures are the only glimpse of our clients’ pet stay when they are away, so it is crucially important to take great pictures. Our clients greatly appreciate this, as it reassures them that their pet is doing great staying at PAWS. What can go wrong? If a client receives a picture of their pet that looks dirty, out of focus, and/or the pet looks sad, the pet parents expect the worst. The pet parent may decide not to come back simply because of a picture where their pet looks sad. As mentioned earlier, the photos sent to pet parents are the only glimpse of their pet's stay - please use extra care and patience when taking photos. The importance of taking great pictures cannot be underestimated. Picture Guidelines The staff member must be trained in taking the photographs by a qualified staff member and all pictures must be approved by a supervisor until we are confident the staff member understands what we are looking for. Pictures should only be taken outside in the greenyards or in the play gym (prioritize taking them in the greenyards). Pictures should never be taken on concrete or have poop buckets/shovels, etc (anything that is dirty). People love to see their dogs interact and having fun. The picture should make the owner happy that they entrusted us with the care of their beloved pet. OBJECTIVE: Happy, clean dogs having fun! Be patient. It can take some time and multiple pictures before you get the perfect photo. THE FOLLOWING IS ENCOURAGED: Colorful, fun images. Pets playing with each other (nicely). Dogs smiling and having fun. Get to the pet’s level. Pictures taken from above looking down are not as flattering. For cats, having them engaged and playing (cat tree is great for this!) THE FOLLOWING IS NOT ALLOWED: Slobber. Poop in the background. Poop buckets in the background. Dirty pets. Out-of-focus images. Wet floor in the play gym. Hair or debris in the background. Aggressive looking animals (including pets in the background of photos). Photos on concrete (unless the concrete is 100% clean and there is some sort of green in the picture). 'Live' photos (feature with iPhones). Sad looking pets (have patience - engage with the pet and try to get them to smile!) Photos with poor lighting. Excessive fencing or foreign objects in the background. Photos taken inside of suites. Departure Pictures for Boarding We send at least one picture of each boarding guest the day before departure. This procedure must be started before the first group starts to ensure all photos will be taken. To access the departure picture list: Navigate to 'Reports & More' > 'Reports' > 'Reservations By Day'. Select tomorrow's date. In the 'Reservation Types' section, select only the boarding options. Press 'Generate Report'. Click 'Lodging' to sort by room order. This will generate both a 'Check Ins' and a 'Check Outs' section. To see only departures: \"X\" out of the 'Check Ins' section. Click 'Lodging' to sort by room order. Then, press 'Print PDF' to print. Highlight all dogs that are in group play. Group leaders are to take photos of group dogs in group play, and pet care technicians will take pictures of the individual play pets during their custom playtimes. All photos must be sent along with the pet's name to the Paws house cell phone number at (203)443-3031 once taken. Pictures can ONLY be sent to the pet parent with supervisor approval. Daycare pictures We always send pictures for a dog's first day of daycare. These are to be sent mid-day, along with a mid-day call to the pet parent to inform them about how their dog is doing. We like to send pictures to existing daycare pet parents, too! If you get a cute picture of a pet while they are in daycare, don't hesitate to send it to the pet parent! Reminder, only send pictures if you are authorized to do so. Social Media Posts We post to Facebook and Instagram on an almost daily basis. When posting to social media, please only select the best photos from the day. For Facebook, it should be around 10-15 photos, and on Instagram, 3-5 photos is a good range. If there are more wonderful photos taken, don't hesitate to post more pictures than these recommendations - but still remember to only post the best photos out of the bunch. Do not post a photo in which you can read a dog's ID collar, as we want to maintain all pet's anonymity online for safety. Please use fun but appropriate captions - some good ideas include the day of the week (ie: \"Sunday Funday!"

    "content": "Dilution of Cleaning Solutions Dilution of Cleaning Solutions Operating Procedure Dilution of Cleaning Solutions S.O.P Odoban is used in mop buckets for cleaning luxury suites, floors in hallways, kitchen and laundry room. Add a half cup of Odoban for each gallon of water. A typical mop bucket holds 3 gallons of water so you would add 1.5 cups of Odoban. Bleach can also be used in mop buckets for cleaning luxury suites, floors, etc but this should only be used as the last cleaning of the night. The bleach dilution for mop buckets is the same as Odoban. Petedge 256 is used in mop buckets for the play gym only. Add ½ tablespoon for each gallon of water. When using the pump dispenser, 4 pumps = 1 tablespoon so you would need 6 pumps (1 ½ tablespoons) to 3 gallons of water. Petedge 256 is used in spray bottles for cleaning walls, doors, cat condos, minis, etc. Add 1 tablespoon (1/2 oz) of 256 to a full gallon (128 oz) of water for a 1:256 dilution. Mix solution in a gallon jug before filling spray bottles to ensure proper dilution. Add water first then 256 to prevent foaming. Petedge 256 is used in the hydrofoamers at full strength. The gray tip located in the dispenser mixes the 256 with water to the proper dilution. Cat bucket for litter scoops-and poop buckets should be filled with 2 gallons of water and add 2 tablespoons (or 8 pumps) of 256 from the concentrated gallon. Dirty litter boxes should be filled halfway with water and add 1 pump of 256 from the concentrated gallon. All chemicals and cleaning supplies must be kept in the laundry room and away from the pets in our care-including foamers. CAUTION! Cleaning products should NEVER be mixed! Cleaning products should NEVER be mixed around or near dogs ! Notify a member of management immediately if a pet comes in contact with or ingests any of our cleaners and then contact poison control. If you think a pet may have ingested a potentially poisonous substance, call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Hotline at (888) 426-4435. A consultation fee may apply. Revised 6/3/24 by CR & RW"

It only takes a few minutes to put the towels/bedding in, fold the things in the dryer, switch over the loads, and fill the washer. Guest bedding will be logged in with suite #, dog’s name, item description, and date. Shake out laundry before loading it into the machine (you’d be surprised at what you find!) If the bedding is really dirty, put it outside and hose it off. If a little dirty rinse in the small laundry room sink before adding to laundry. Loosely fill the washer 3/4 full. Do not overload. Sprinkle ~1/4 cup of dry detergent for a full load, less for smaller loads on top of laundry. Select appropriate load size. Water temp = cool Cycle = normal/regular When the wash cycle is complete, shake out the items before placing them in the dryer. If items are still very wet, rearrange the items and run the “drain spin” cycle again. Do not put sopping wet items in the dryer. Mop heads do not go in the dryer. Hang them to air dry. Clean lint trap with every load When the dryer is complete, fold the laundry and put away. All bedding and cleaning rags are folded with like edges lined up and stored on wire racks by size, color and type. Grooming towels are folded and stored in the grooming room. Luxury fleeces are folded then rolled so they can fit into the cubbies neatly without any raw edges showing. Extra luxury fleece can be placed rolled up on top of the cubbies. Put away the folded laundry. Don’t leave it on the windowsill. If the house bedding has a lot of holes please throw it out. If it only has a few we may be able to cut it and reuse it- place it in the designated spot in the laundry room above the sink. Return guest bedding to their suites. Check off the guest laundry log. If we will not be returning guest bedding to the suite, label it with the name, suite number, dates of stay and reason why it is not to be returned. Store it in the kitchen near the food bag with the label facing out. The laundry should be done continuously throughout the day. Laundry should not be left for the p.m. shift and never left overnight unless there are not enough items to start a new load. Make sure the laundry room is neat and tidy and tour ready at all times. Wipe down all surfaces, including the sides and doors of the washing machine and dryer. Sweep and mop as needed. All mop buckets will be emptied at the end of each shift (with exceptions if the bucket is new). Cat scoops and litter boxes will be cleaned and put away before the end of each shift. At the end of the day the room will be thoroughly swept and mopped being sure to get under and behind mop buckets, brooms, etc. All surfaces will be wiped down and disinfected with 256."

    "content": "Performing a Wellness Check Performing a Wellness Check Opertating Procedure 5-Point Wellness Check: A wellness check will be performed with every walk and rotation. The 5 Points of a Wellness Check: Eyes Observe the guest’s eyes. They should be clear and bright, full of life. Eyes that appear dull and lifeless could be a sign of “trouble brewing.” Dull eyes could also be a sign of anxiety and stress. Check to see if there is any discharge, swelling, opacities or ulcerations (sores). Pay particular attention to pugs, Pekingese, Lhasas and Persian breeds that have protruding eyes and are prone to eye difficulties. Teeth Place hand on top of the bridge of the guest’s nose and the other under the mandible (underside of snout). Gently part the lips with your fingers to expose the teeth and gums. Look for any broken, missing or stained teeth, any gum conditions, excessive tarter and noticeably unpleasant odors. Ears Stand beside the guest, taking one hand to lift the flap of the ear. Observe how the dog reacts to having ears touched. Shying away or fear may be a sign of ear pain or chronic problems. Bend the ear back slightly, and use your other hand to spread apart the cartilage part of the ear. Check the ear canal for any discharge, inflammation, dirt or excessive amounts of wax or hair growth. A healthy ear will appear light pink and have no odor. Repeat the above steps on the other side of the guest to check the opposite ear. Skin and Coat With your fingers, life the hair against the direction of the coat growth, looking for abrasions, skin irritations, dry skin, growths or other abnormal conditions. Does the coat appear healthy and shiny, or dull and lifeless? Look for any urine burns or stains, or fecal matter attached to the coat. Check for any matted areas, as they often conceal sores or parasites. Check the coat in all areas, including under the jaw, behind the ears, neck, elbows, chest, stomach, inside rear legs and hocks, and above and below the tail. Legs, Paws, and Genitals Male guests - Check the scrotum for any signs of irritation, abnormal growth, swelling or excessive warmth. Check the penis for any signs of unusual discharge (occasional, slightly greenish discharge is considered normal). Female guests - Check the vulva for any signs of enlargement or discharge. Check the mammary glands for any lumps or swelling. Pay particular attention to signs of estrus (heat) in an unaltered female. All guests, male and female - Check the anal area for evidence of tapeworm segments, anal gland swelling or other irritations. Additional items to assess: Assess the dog’s demeanor. Do they seem alert and responsive, or listless or lethargic? Check for any signs of bloat (see symptoms below). Bloat is a very serious health risk for dogs. Bloating of a dog’s stomach is usually related to swallowed air (although food and fluid can be present). It usually happens when there is an abnormal accumulation of air, fluid, and/or foam in the stomach. Stress can be a significant contributing factor as well. As the stomach swells, it can rotate, causing the fixed attachments between the esophagus and upper intestine to twist. The twisting stomach traps air, food, and water in the stomach. The bloated stomach obstructs veins in the abdomen, leading to low blood pressure, shock, and damage to internal organs. This combined effect can lead to the death of a dog. Most common symptoms of bloat: Attempts to vomit unsuccessfully, every 5-30 minutes. This is one of the most common signs. Frequently “asking” to go outside to eliminate, significantly more often than normal Significant anxiety or restlessness “Hunched Up” or “Roached Up” appearance Bloated abdomen that feels tight (like a drum) IF YOU OBSERVE AND POTENTIAL SIGNS OF BLOAT, IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE SHIFT SUPERVISOR, WELLNESS MANAGER, OR LOCATION MANAGER."

REQUIRED - Must be current to visit Paws Pet Resort & Spa for ANY service. DOGS CATS Rabies Rabies Distemper Feline Distemper Bordetella Negative Fecal Within Past 12 Months Current Dog Town License (Paper Copy) DETAILS: Dogs: Rabies - in most states, the Rabies vaccines are required to be given to dogs over 3-4 months of age and every 3 years. Rabies vaccines are given to protect people, not dogs. Because rabies is typically a fatal disease after the onset of symptoms, the goal is to protect the public from contracting rabies. DHLP is a five-way vaccine that includes viral diseases canine distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, and bacterial infection leptospirosis. Distemper is an airborne virus that is also transmitted through bodily fluids and attacks the intestinal and respiratory tracts, as well as the central nervous system. Bordetella - The bordetella vaccine is given to both puppies and adult dogs. This vaccine helps to ward off a frequent illness that is known as canine cough. Canine cough is easily spread from one dog to another and is highly contagious. In healthy adult dogs, the condition is similar to common cold in humans. NOTE: The bordetella vaccine should be delivered not less than 3 days prior to arrival. A Paws Pet Resort Owner or Manager MUST approve the acceptance of dog receiving a \"last minute\" bordetella vaccine.' Negative fecal test within past 12 months : We require at least an Ova & Parasite test (OP), and prefer an Ova, Parasite, and Giardia (OPG) test. Please refer to the fecal results sheet for more information. Current Dog Town License (paper copy): Required by Connecticut state law. If their primary residence is not located in Connecticut, we or the customer must provide proof that the area they live in does not mandate a dog license. An example can be a state website that says this, or verbal confirmation by a town clerk. Note: Rabies and Dog Town License must be uploaded to client's file on Gingr. RECOMMENDED Canine Influenza causes mild respiratory disease and is associated with outbreaks in densely housed dogs or those with frequent connections to other dogs. The vaccination for both common strains is recommended. H3N2 H3N8 Cats: Rabies - Rabies vaccines are given to protect people, not cats. Because rabies is typically a fatal disease after the onset of symptoms, the goal is to protect the public from contracting rabies. Feline Distemper Combo (FVRCP) - three-way vaccine, is an important core vaccine that all cats should be must up to date on. It's made up of three separate vaccinations, FVR (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis), Calici, and Panleukopenia. Clients should email all paperwork to: info@pawspet.com"

You may need to gather any luggage that is present in the pet's room. This includes toys, treats, blankets, EVERYTHING they brought in! Check to make sure any bedding or any belongings are not soiled or wet and that it does not smell foul or have excessive hair on it. Immediately inform the shift supervisor and take it to the laundry if it does. (Don't forget to log it on the guest laundry sheet!) Make sure to keep all items together for each guest, especially if they have multiple bags. Once all items are collected and signed off on, sign your initials on the left of the pet's name. There should be nothing missing. Proceed to the kitchen hallway with the luggage. DO NOT PUT ANY PERISHABLE FOOD ITEMS IN HALLWAY! If any belongings, food, etc, is in the refridgerator or freezer, put a sticky note on their other bag in the hallway. Example \" Murphy has bag of Freshpet in fridge \". If they don't have another bag, attach the note to the luggage sheet that will be in the hallway. This will ensure reception will know to give all belongings back. ENSURE ALL ITEMS ARE FOUND, IF ANYTHING IS MISSING, TELL A MANAGER AND ENSURE IT IS FOUND BEFORE THE DAY ENDS! Once all items are in the hallway, place the corresponding report cards in each bag.

Proceed to each guest’s room (in logical order, starting with East). READ THE TAG FOR THE ROOM NUMBER, NAME, AND BREED , to ensure the food bowl is being delivered to the right guest. Enter the Guest's room and place the food on the ground. Remove any old food bowl from their room. Exit and ensure the door is shut and secure. If water is low or empty, re-fill with clean water. If there is hair or debris in the water, dump old water into the floor drain before re-filling. Once all the bowls are delivered, wipe off the cart and return it back to the kitchen, put any dirty bowls in the sink to be cleaned, and throw out all the feeding tags. When you are done, walk around to be sure everyone is fed. If they do not have food, check their room card to confirm that they shouldn’t have food, as some dogs are fed only once a day. Medications If no special instructions are given, meds are delivered with the feeds. Confirm that the guest’s name on the room card matches the name and room number on the Medications Report. IF THERE ARE TWO DOGS IN THE ROOM, double-check the pet ID collars to make sure you are delivering the medications to the correct dog, especially if the dogs are the same breed. Try different methods of giving meds (pill pockets, chicken, pb). Watch for allergies! Ask for help if needed. MAKE SURE THE PET HAS EATEN THE MEDICATION! Sign off AFTER you are SURE medication has been consumed and/or administered. Multiple pets in the same room If two or more dogs are in a room but do not have to be separated, place bowls in separate corners, do not place them side by side. Sometimes, it is noted on the feeding tag that the dogs must be seperated to feed, otherwise one dog will eat both meals. In this case, put the dog in a separate room, let them finish their meals, and BE SURE TO RETURN THE MOVED DOG BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ROOM."

    "title": "Preparing AM PM Feeds",
    "url": "/kb/petcare-procedures/Preparing_AM__PM_Feeds.html",
    "content": "Preparing AM PM Feeds Preparing AM & PM Feeds Operating Procedure PRINTING AM & PM FEEDS Following these critical steps will ensure each pet gets fed accurately. In Gingr, start by accessing the “Feeding Report” under the Reports section. Select “Show animals without feeding info”, and deselect “Only show animals currently checked in,” to make sure it matches the image below. Next, select “Lodging”, to ensure the rooms show in alphabetical order. Then, make sure every animal has at least one “feeding box” on the right hand side. Most, if not all animals will have at least one feeding box, which means they will show up once we print the feeding report. If an animal does not have a box, this means the animal will not show up on the feeding report once you go to print it. To fix an animal that does not have feeding info, open the animal’s name in a new tab, and hit the pencil, then click on the animal's name as shown below. Then, scroll down on the animal profile until you come across the feeding schedule section. Occasionally, there will be notes at the bottom of the feeding schedule which we will add to the AM, Lunch, PM, or appropriate slot depending on what the feeding notes say. Most of the time, however, there will not be feeding notes. In this case, just type “1 Bag Own Food” under the AM and PM slots, since this is the most common feeding schedule (if the owner specifies different feeding instructions at dropoff, we can change them accordingly). The point of adding the standard “1.00 Bag Own Food” is so that the animal will show up when we go to print the report. See example below: Now, press save at the bottom of the animal profile to save, and close out of that tab. Return back to the feeding report tab, and scroll down to ensure every animal has at least one feeding box. Once you have added information to every animal that needs it, refresh the page to ensure each and every animal has at least one feeding box. Great! Now we are prepared to print out feeds. Once again, ensure the correct boxes are selected, and press the lodging button to ensure the report is in alphabetical order by lodging name. Then select only the PM report for today's date, and press “Get PDF” - print two copies. After this, change the date on top to tomorrow's date. Then select AM. Print two copies. Highlight any instructions that include wet food, which will be spice ups. Then, staple one PM feeding report together, and cut up the other copy where the lines are - do the same for AM feeding report. To print lunches, see “How-To: Lunches and Gourmet Treats” MAKING AM & PM FEEDS Important notes: On a pet's first day, by default we do not serve them their AM meal , unless the customer asks us to. It is reception's duty to ask if their pet has been fed today, and to either notify the person making feeds to prepare the AM meal, or for the receptionist to simply make the feeds and give them to the pet. By default, we do not make/give the PM meal for departures, unless desired by the customer and a feeding note is made. For the feeds you highlighted, these are known as spice ups (anything that has wet food or cannot sit out for hours). Put AM \"spice ups\" on the named shelf on the right of where feeds are prepared, and PM spice ups on the counter in between the refrigerator and the oven. On each feeding cart, allocate each bowl to each corresponding shelf on the cart: TOP SHELF: East, In-Between. MIDDLE SHELF: West, Outside West. BOTTOM SHELF: Luxuries, Minis, and Cats. - Note that North food bowls have their own designated AM/PM feeding cart, and are made in the North kitchen, not in the main building. It is recommended to use a tablet or a phone while making feeds to quickly see if a pet is checked in, leaving, or arriving. Navigate to www.pawspet.gingrapp.com on a mobile device and use your login details. We make AM and PM feeds at the same time. Use the PM cart for PM feeds, and AM cart to hold the AM feeds. The AM and PM feeding list and tags should be side by side when making feeds. When making feeds, you must pull one bag off the shelf at a time. After you are done with one bag, you MUST take the NEXT bag off the shelf. This ensures all bags are handled and adds another level of safety to ensure every pet gets fed. When you are making feeds and the pet's name is on the list, but the bag is not on the shelf, this can mean: The pet has not arrived yet The pet has left, or is leaving today and the bag is in the hallway. If the pet has not arrived yet: Check the \"Expected Today\" section on the dashboard of Gingr to see if they are coming in today. If they are scheduled to arrive today, tape their AM and/or PM tags on the shelf next to where you make feeds. This will notify team members that the animal's feeds still need to be made. If they are not scheduled to arrive today and are not checked in, throw the tag away. If the pet has left, or is leaving today: If you have confirmed using Gingr the pet has left, throw out their feeding tags. If the pet is leaving today, our protocol is to not make the PM feed *unless wanted and it is notated in feeding notes*. Follow the feeding instructions listed on the tags carefully until all bags have been handled. If you are making feeds and find any feeding information doesn't match up, notify reception or management. If there are any pets that have run out of food, you MUST notify reception or management so we can call the client and have them decide what to feed their pet(s). NEVER ASSUME A PET HAS NO ALLERGIES, AND/OR GIVE THEM HOUSE FOOD OR TREATS WITHOUT OWNER'S PERMISSION!"

Bring all dogs to a holding area. Let the Manager on Duty know if the dog needs a clean-up bath, especially if they are scheduled to go home. Remove all beds, bowls, toys, etc., from the floor. (all customer belongings should be labeled so they go back to the correct dog. If it is not labeled, please do so.) If anything is dirty, wet, or smelly; bring it to the laundry room (make sure to log any customer belongings on the guest laundry sheet). All items must be returned to the customer clean. Scoop any spilled food or solid waste. You must mark the run card for any elimination in their room and record food and water intake. Foam the main hallway floor, then walls, doors, floors and resting bench. Be sure to do the panel next to the door and the base of the bars and let sit for 10 minutes. Start the extra cleaning (see below). Rinse the walls first, top to bottom, rinse floor from front to back, top of resting bench, flip up and rinse bottom of resting bench. While rinsing, have the hose in one hand and a scrub brush in the other to tackle any remaining grime. Lastly, flush the drain towards the drain bucket until clean. Leave benches up to allow them to drip dry until you are done. Continue washing all bedrooms in this manner on both sides, from back to front On Mondays and more often as needed, empty drain buckets. Drain buckets are located in E 1, E 23, and W 1 and W 23. Lift the resting bench and lift the drain bucket out of the well to drip dry in the drain. Empty the drain buckets into a trash bag, clean and replace. Squeegee the doors; two swipes from top to bottom Squeegee the main hallway; two swipes angled towards the rooms Squeegee each bedroom from front to back, two swipes and gently put down the bench.

If any dogs had belongings, put those back in with them now (give out our beds as needed to non chewers only). Bring all dogs back into their rooms. Extra Cleaning Refer to the posted checklist to see which 3 rooms will have the extra cleaning. Use an old broom and mop bucket filled with hot water, large and small hand brush, magic sponge, and cleaning cloths. Dip broom into mop bucket and scrub floors. Focus on edges, corners, and under the resting benches. All of the surfaces will already be soapy from foaming in the previous step. Rinse with one hand and use a hand brush with the other for bars, walls, and doorframes (especially the bases where grime sits. The brushes work great for breaking down the initial heavy grime while the magic sponge works well for the stubborn residue. Use the magic sponge on the glass doors inside and out. Squeegee the front and back of the 3 glass doors. Use foaming window cleaner and wipe the fronts and backs to make the glass shine. In addition to the insides of the suites, clean the outside just as well. Rinse the walls from top to bottom and front to back. Keep a sponge or brush on hand to remove any additional spots you’ve missed. Wipe down the metal frames with a rag, including the tops. Daily Outside West/In Between Cleaning: During the PM shift, clean any hallways that were used for daycare or boarding dogs during the day. These areas are cleaned the same as East and West wings. Move all to a holding area. Make sure reception is aware of their locations. Foam, Extra Clean, Rinse, and Squeegee. Put down water bowls and fill if the hallway will be occupied the following day (ex: don’t fill water bowls Friday night as areas will not be used for daycare on Saturday). Ask if you’re unsure."

    "content": "Booking Reservations Boarding and Daycare Booking Reservations (Boarding and Daycare) Operating Procedure This procedure will ensure that all boarding and daycare reservations are booked accurately, efficiently, and easily! Important Notes: We only require deposits for boarding reservations, not daycare. One deposit per family is required, not per pet. If a pet stays for more than 2 weeks, we charge their card on file every week and apply a pre-payment to their reservation. We must let the client know of this, and we must keep a card on file for these situations. Dogs are mandated to have a play package, but cats are not. Please use the icons to see what the client typically gets when booking a reservation. If booking a daycare reservation, ensure the correct daycare type is being booked - there are lots of different options, so be sure to check client's history and ask the client if you are unsure. DOG BOARDING: Start by navigating to the 'New Reservation' screen. There are two ways to achieve this: On the left hand side menu on Gingr, go to Reservations > New Reservation. Or, on pet or owner profile screen, press the calendar with plus button at the top right of the screen, and press 'New Reservation.' Ensure pet(s)' name is selected under the 'Pet's' section.

Select the desired lodging area to open view all available rooms. Press ‘+’ button to assign the pet to the desired room. (Yellow means a pet is already occupying that room, you must select an open room for all dates of stay). If necessary, write any reservation notes under the 'Notes' section. If customer asks for an estimate, you can use the estimate section to see what each individual price is. DO NOT give totals for boarding stays, since there are many factors that can change the total price of the reservation before the pet leaves. However, you may give them each individual price. Once all details are entered, press ' Save ' at the bottom of the screen. Take the $50 deposit (one per family) see \"Checking Out Pets\" procedure if you need help with processing payments. If you need to access the reservation for any reason after you press save, you can do so by clicking on the confirmation link at the bottom of the screen as soon as you press save, or you can do so by searching for the client's name in Gingr and go to the reservations section to locate the reservation.

Filing daycare cards means putting them in the bin in perfect alphabetical order by LAST NAME . If you notice any duplicates, boarding cards, or dogs who have not been here in month's room cards, please remove them and discard them. We need to constantly maintain our beloved room card bin.

Select the tomorrow's date. In the 'Reservation Types' section, select only the daycare options. Press 'Generate Report'. \"X\" out of either the 'Check Ins' or 'Check Outs' section. Since daycares are for only one day, we must \"X\" out of one of them, otherwise the report will be duplicated. Then, press 'Print PDF' to print. You must pull all of the cards on this list. If any cards are not in the bin already, you must print a new one. Navigate to the pet's daycare reservation. At the top right of the screen, press the print button and press 'Print Run Card'.

Mark up the run card - cross off room number if it has it, cross off reservation type and date, and write 'D/C' to show it is a daycare card. Then put the card in a plastic sleeve and file away. Pulling daycare room cards: putting the card \"up\" 90 degrees so it stands taller, making it easier to locate. ALL room cards need to be filed and pulled the night advance. Run card bin maintenance Whenever possible, it is important to remove any duplicates, boarding cards, or dogs who have not been here for month's room cards.

Some companies provide a guarantee with their product. note3 This parasite is not infectious or contagious, but it does indicate the pet is hunting small wild animals (such as mice/chipmunks/rabbits) or is eating wild animal feces. note4 Tapeworms are not normally reported on fecal test results. Fortunately they are not contagious, but they are infectious and need to be treated. Tapeworm segments are normally diagnosed by a veterinarian by observation with the naked eye. Either on a fecal sample or the perianal region. A veterinarian can then place the segment onto a slide and set a microscope to low-power and determine if the tapeworm segment came from the pet eating a flea or eating a rodent. The OP fecal is a microscope test that is looking for microscopic eggs/cysts/organisms on high-power so they cannot observe tapeworm segments References Capcvet.org Cdc.gov Nih.gov Version 20230818"

Every customer should be listened to and valued in order to feel good about leaving their pets here with us. We are honored that they entrust us with their most beloved pets, and it is our duty to provide nothing but the best customer service. First Impression Matters Please ensure the lobby is in excellent condition. Making sure it smells good, free of hair/debris on the floor, and is organized are key to a great first impression. In order to portray a professional appearance, we value having the front desk staff wearing collared shirts and a genuine smile. The front desk staff should be as neat as possible and on the conservative side, i.e. no excessive piercings, gum chewing, etc. Our objective is to present ourselves as being organized, caring, courteous, professional, and trustworthy - our customers deserve our best! Greeting Customers As soon as a customer walks in, you must halt what you are doing, and greet the customer. Even if you are handling another task, you must still acknowledge the customer and let them know you will be with them shortly. All staff will greet every customer they encounter with a big smile and a friendly, genuine, enthusiastic greeting. If their dog is present, greet the dog as well. Greet the dog by name if possible and say something nice about the dog. If there is a client in the lobby and you are unsure if they are being taken care of, always ask if they are being assisted. Check in and out pets as fast as possible, while maintaining accuracy. We don't want our customers to wait in the lobby for a long time. Use caution with what you say if there are customers in the lobby. Even if you think they can't hear you, they may be able to. Importance of a 'Paws'-itive attitude No matter how busy it is, it is important to portray to our customers that we have things under control. We do not want them to \"see us sweat.\" Everyone at Paws must come to work with a 'paws'-itive attitude each and every day. A negative attitude can spread among coworkers and very quickly lead to a negative work environment. The pets deserve our best performance, and a \"can-do\" attitude is necessary to provide excellent care no matter the circumstance. Regardless of personal feelings or challenges, we commit to setting aside any distractions at the door and dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to delivering the best possible experience for both the animals and customers in our care every single day. Unconditional Listening We must always listen to our customers, even if we think they are wrong. Remember, \"the customer is always right!\" If a customer takes the time to tell us something, it is clearly something they are concerned about so much that they thought they would let us know. They are providing us with valuable feedback, and it is imperative to unconditionally listen and try to help as best you can! NEVER argue with a customer. Instead, listen attentively and genuinely try to understand what they are saying. If you deem what they are saying is incorrect, instead of using the words \"you're wrong,\" say \"actually,...\" and proceed to describe the truth. If you are uncomfortable speaking with a customer, ask for a supervisor or manager."

Printing Boarding Arrival Room Cards Navigate to 'Reports & More' > 'Reports' > 'Print Run Cards' Select today's date. Under 'Reservation Type', select only the boarding options. Press 'Print Run Cards!' - DO NOT ACTUALLY PRINT THEM YET! At the top right of the screen, it will say 'Run Card 1 of [XX] ' Look at the total number of run cards. In a new tab (not closing out of the old tab) , access the 'Run Card' document on the 'Paws HQ' Google Sheets document. Print out the correct total number of run card bottoms. Once the correct number of run card bottoms are printed, put them in the printer tray faced down, with the printed material at the top. Navigate back to the old tab with all the arrival room cards, and press print. The room cards have been successfully printed. On the top left of each room card for dogs only, write what type of play they go to (individual, big, small, or medium). If the dog needs to be evaluated for group, write 'eval'. For all areas besides Luxury Suites and Cat Rooms, fold paper in half and put it in a plastic sleeve. Place all room cards on the table next to the R2 desk in alphabetical order and separated by area for easy access. Also, make sure there is tape to hang up the Luxury Suite and Mini Mansion room cards. Printing ID collars for all arriving boarding dogs Note: only dogs get ID collars. On the 'Expected Today' section on the dashboard, search 'dog boarding'. Filter by lodging type to sort pets by area. Open every filtered reservation in a new tab - to do this, click on the text for the type of the reservation (ex: 'Standard Dog Boarding'). Either right click the text and press open in a new tab, or simply push the scroll wheel down to open the reservation in a new tab. Proceed to open all reservations in their own new tab. Navigate to the first tab you opened, and press the print button at the top right, and then click 'Print Labels'. This will give you access to a printing preview screen. (Note: if this does not show up, it is because pop-ups are disabled. You must enable popups in order for this screen to show up.) Press CTRL + P to print - ensure the destination is set to 'Petdetect Raster Printer' Under 'Copies' you must use the chart below to determine how long the collar will be. Smaller Breeds (<35 Lbs) Medium or Larger Breeds (~35-80 Lbs) (Most Common) Extra Large Breeds (>80 Lbs) 3 Labels Long 4 Labels Long 5 Labels Long Once the correct number of copies is entered and the correct printing destination is set, print out the label. Labels should be printing now - if they are not, We have a switch (on the cash drawer) to swap between printing from the R1/R2 computer. Ensure that the light on the switch refects the computer you are currently using. Ensure there is a roll of label tape fed into the label printer (the colored side should be down - the roll of label tape fed into the machine should be the one on the left. There must be three rolls of label tape, side-by-side, in order for the label printer to work properly. Again - only the leftmost roll should be fed into the machine. If the label machine is stalling/not printing well, ensure the roll is aligned perfectly, with no additional slack. If the label machine is not cutting each collar well, wipe off the blade CAREFULLY with a disinfectant wipe. Remove all built-on gunk with the wipe and it should cut perfectly after. Proceed to print all ID collars. Once all ID collars are printed, stick them to the back wall behind the reception desk in room order (remove one smaller section of the back of the sticker and place on wall). Double-check that all ID collars have been correctly printed."

Place their leash, harness, and/or collar (and bag, if applicable) on the appropriate, labeled hook in the hallway. PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS ON THE RIGHT HOOK! Ensure Gingr reflects the pet's accurate room. Note: If a pet changes anything with their reservation (daycare type, different service, etc), you must tell the back staff as soon as possible. If a pet adds on a grooming service for today's date, let the specific groomer know. WHERE TO ASSIGN DAYCARE DOGS: - Save \"Jumbo\" rooms for very large dogs or families with multiple pets.

    "content": "Checking Out Pets Checking Out Pets Operating Procedure To check out any reservation or appointment: Greet customer with warm smile, ask who they are picking up (pet's first AND LAST NAME! ) . Start by looking at what room the pet is in from the dashboard. From the dashboard, click the cart button to add the reservation or appointment to the cart. If a dog has daycare punches, there will be a \"quick checkout\" button, which will automatically check the dog out. This button will work only if the daycare reservation has no add-ons attached. If the daycare reservation has services attached, proceed to the next step. Navigate to the check-out page by clicking the cart icon on the top right of the screen. Based on the reservation or appointment type, follow the steps below this checklist to ensure accurate check-outs. Come back here once you have followed the steps. Once you have followed the steps below this checklist and confirmed the invoice has the correct pricing, Press the 'Check Out With Payment' Button. Select payment method If using credit card, Gingr may show a credit card may already be on file. Ask client if it is ok to use it. If a credit card is not on file already, select the 'Credit Card' payment method. If the client has the card in person, select 'WisePos E' to connect to the credit card terminal to swipe or tap it. If the credit card terminal is not working, enter it manually into Gingr: You may also manually enter the credit card information into Gingr. Select 'Enter Card Number in Gingr' to do this. Always ask client if they would like to save the new card to their file for future use. In this case, select the 'Save Card to File?' option BEFORE processing the credit card. If using cash, Select 'Cash' payment method. Collect appropriate amount of cash from customer, and put it in the cash drawer (there is a set of keys for the cash drawer in each reception desk.) Give back any change. If using check, Select 'Check' payment method. Collect check, ensure it has the accurate price. Stamp the back of the check with one of the \"Pay to the Order of...\" stamp machines that is in the reception desk drawers. Place check in cash drawer. If the payment method is split or if there is a store credit or gift certificate: If there are multiple payment methods, enter the desired amount of the first payment method. For any additional payment methods, select 'Add Payment Method.' If there is a store credit, mention this at checkout to the client and use this payment method first. If the customer brings in a coupon, use the 'Gift Certificate' or 'Customer Appreciation' payment method first, enter the amount of the gift certificate or coupon, and proceed to collect the remaining balance with the client's desired form of payment. Be sure to collect and discard of any coupons or gift certificates from clients, as they can only be used once. Charge the balance and ensure there is no remaining balance left. Once payment has been processed, ask client if they would like an emailed or printed receipt. Gingr will automatically bring up this screen after payment is processed. If you forgot what room the pet is in, navigate to the 'Lodging Calendar' and do a ' CTRL + F ' search for the pet's name. Be sure to keep in mind last name as well! (We have lots of Bellas!) Obtain the pet's belongings and give them to the client first. Use the leash if they brought one in, and: Proceed to get pet(s) from their room If a pet is not in their room, they may be in playtime or grooming. Check these two areas and if still not located, ask coworkers as they will likely know where the pet is. Ensure the right pet is returned to owner by checking ID collar if applicable and asking coworkers if you are unsure. Bring them to their owner! \"Have a wonderful rest of your day!\" Lodging Departures Once the reservation is added to the cart, TO ADJUST SOMETHING OFF AN INVOICE: Add an open line item to the cart. Select type as 'Price Adjustment,' enter a description of what the adjustment is, and enter the price in. Adjusting peak rates: If the departure day is a peak date and late checkout is not charged, you must remove one peak rate charge from the invoice. This is because Gingr charges the peak rate daily, but the lodging rate nightly. The price of a peak charge is $10 per day. Please add an open line item of 'Price Adjustment', type 'Peak' under description, and enter in -10. If there are multiple pets in the family, you must add a -10 peak line item for each pet in the family. REMINDER: THIS IS ONLY WHEN THE LAST DAY IS A PEAK DATE, AND THE LATE CHECKOUT FEE IS NOT CHARGED. Late checkout: Cost of one nightly lodging rate, will be charged: Normal: If has Bath or Groom: After 11:00AM After 3:00PM * 5:00PM on Sundays HOW TO WAIVE LATE CHECKOUT (if applicable): Once item is in cart, start by seeing what the nightly lodging rate is. Click the arrow next to where it says \"Reservation For [ Pet's Name ]\" to locate this. If the departure day is a peak date, add both the nightly lodging rate listed and the peak charge, which is an additional $10 together to get a total late checkout fee. (Example: if the rate says $59.95, and it is a peak date, add $10 to get $69.95). Add an open line item: Use the 'Waive Late Checkout | Grooming Service' and enter in the lodging price you discovered in step 2. (Make sure it is a negative price) Add the discount to the cart, and proceed to the next steps of the checkout process. You must review each item, line by line, to ensure the receipt is accurate. To ensure all information is correct, follow this information: Daycare, Grooming, and Retail Invoices: Once again, at check out you must review each item, line by line, to ensure the receipt is accurate. If there is a grooming service on reservation, insure it has a price. If you are sure it was not completed, keep the service on the reservation without a price, as we want to keep a record of it. Ensure pet care warranty quantity is correct HOW TO CHECK OUT A CUSTOMER FOR A PUNCHCARD (DAYCARE PACKAGE) OR A RETAIL ITEM: Navigate directly to the cart (press the cart button on the top right of the screen). Select the owner. Press 'browse retail' If item desired is a punchcard, select the desired punchcard option. If item is a retail item, you can either scan the barcode with a barcode scanner, or search for it on the browse retail screen. If retail item is not showing up anywhere, add an 'Other (Read Description) - Taxable' Open line item. Add a description of what the item is and the price. After the customer has left, tell a manager that the item could not be located in Gingr. Check out the customer with their preferred payment method(s) - if needed, see information above for detailed instruction on how to process payment. IF THE QUICK CHECKOUT BUTTON IS NOT WORKING (Daycare): If customer has a punchcard and it is not working, ensure the punchcard type they have matches the daycare reservation type they are checked in for. IF THERE ARE BOTH ADD-ONS AND A DAYCARE PUNCH BEING USED: If there are add-ons (such as a grooming service) to a daycare reservation with a client that has a punchcard, you must add the daycare reservation to the cart and follow the steps below:"

    "content": "Understanding Store Credit and Deposits Understanding Store Credit and Deposits Overview Store Credit A Store Credit is a type of discount. You can think of it as a balance they can use on their account, like a gift card. Once a Store Credit has been added to a Client's account, it can be applied to an Invoice at check-out, either on the same day it was added or on the future date. Store Credits CANNOT be exchanged for money. They have no \"cash value \". Deposits: A Deposit is a pre-payment by a Client. FULL PAYMENT MUST BE COLLECTED when the Deposit is added to the Client's reservation. A $50 deposit MUST be taken for each boarding reservation, one deposit per family. A Deposit has a monetary value. It can be refunded. Deposits are only required for boarding reservations. A client can put a deposit down for a grooming or daycare reservation if wanted, but it is not necessary. Deposit Policy: I n the event the client needs to change plans, we ask that they notify us two weeks prior to the reservation during peak times or three days prior during non-peak times. With management approval, we can refund the deposit past our deposit policy if the customer experiences something out of their control. Pre-Payments: Pre-payments function just like deposits. You can add Pre-Payments by opening up the invoice for the reservation. Use the \"Apply Payment\" button to add a Pre-Payment. The uses for Pre-Payments can be: If a customer wants to put down a deposit more than the standard $50 for their reservation. If a customer wants to pay for their service or reservation before check out. (Keep in mind we DO NOT give totals for boarding stays before checkout, and they cannot completely pay for their boarding reservation in advance, since there are a myriad of factors that can change the total price of the reservation before the pet leaves.) When a pet stays for extended lengths of time, we charge their card on file every week and apply a pre-payment to their reservation."

    "title": "Staff Scheduling",
    "url": "/kb/ other/Staff_Scheduling.html",
    "content": "Staff Scheduling Staff Scheduling Operating Procedure This procedure pertains to the senior staff member(s) who are creating the schedule but may be useful to other staff members to know how we create the schedule. The number of staff scheduled is based on how many pets we have in-house. We predict our future occupancy based on current reservations and last year's occupancy. It is best to be slightly over-scheduled and send someone home early or call them out in advance. The Occupied Runs List for the week will be reviewed against the schedule to be sure we are staffing appropriately and must be printed the day before and tasks assigned to double-check that the staffing is adequate. The schedule must be posted at least two weeks in advance. When making the schedule, keep in mind: We want to have a good mix of experienced staff to train new staff. Avoid having two inexperienced staff members on at the same time performing a similar task. Schedule a more experienced bather with a less experienced, more experienced receptionist with a less experienced receptionist, etc. We aim to fully leverage our experienced staff to help accelerate the development of our less experienced team members. Avoid overtime unless it is absolutely necessary. When approving a pick-up or swap, verify that the employee(s) will not incur overtime. Do not count staff members in training. Always schedule trainees with a senior staff member. When we are not busy, we typically schedule 6 in the morning and 4 in the evening. As we get busier, we want to add extra pet care technicians for up to 13 in the morning and 11 in the evening. Add an extra bather on high departure dates. Every Shift Should Include the Following: Manager = Oversees all operations to ensure staffing efficiency and operational accuracy. Receptionist 1 = Primary receptionist; oversees all activity at the front desk to ensure accuracy and excellent customer service. Receptionist 2 = Assists R1 and, when not occupied at the front desk, can help in the back. However, they must remain in a position where they can oversee the front desk in case their support is needed. Reservation Specialist [ No RS on Sunday ] = Handles new customer calls, books reservations, and can assist with front desk duties, cleaning, and other tasks as needed. Shift Lead 1 = Senior shift lead; supervises pet care department and is responsible for coordinating tasks such as training, assigning areas, playtimes, and cleaning. Shift Lead 2 = Assists shift lead 1; supervises pet care department. Pet Care Technicians = Handles cleaning, walks, playtimes, and other pet-related tasks. One must be available to cover group breaks. Every A.M. Shift Should Also Include: Bather = Helps with morning cleaning unless there are a large number of baths. After completing the baths, assists the pet care team as needed. Group Play Attendants = Assists with morning cleaning, creates playlists, conducts new dog evaluations, monitors playgroups, and cleans the play gym and outdoor areas. All positions will start at 6:45 unless otherwise noted. We have found that having two PCT come in at 5:30 to get an early start of cleaning helps with the daycare rush at 7 a.m. If we are not busy we may have the Group Play P.M. Schedule = Every p.m. schedule will usually have one R1, R2, and two Pet Care Technician. During very slow times we may be fine with only one Pet Care Technician. Staff start time should be staggered so they are able to complete all duties with ease. R1 & R2 will be scheduled from 1:30 p.m – 8 p.m. R2 will do the rotations at 2:30, bring the dogs in from play at 3 p.m. and cats. Pet Care Technician 3:30 (hand out feeds), If there is another pet care technician, they can be scheduled for 4:30 to get there in time for walks, etc. R2, and the pet care technicians will do any left-over play times, clean west, etc. R1 (1:30 pm – 8 pm) = responsible for everything that goes on at the front desk R2 (1:30 pm – 8 pm) = helps R1 as needed, otherwise works in back. R2 will do the rotations at 2:30, bring the dogs in from play at 3 p.m. and cats. Pet Care Technicians (1:30-3:30 pm – 8 pm) = hand out feeds, walks, closing tasks etc. During busy times we will have up to 6 staff members in the evening. Ramp up as needed. Manager/Supervisor may send staff home early if we are slow. Things to Keep in Mind When Creating the Schedule Staffing is our biggest expense. We do not want to be overstaffed. We find that with a lean staff everyone is more efficient. Mondays can be busy with departures from the weekends. We may need to schedule an extra person in the morning on Mondays. Fridays are usually very busy with arrivals. We should schedule someone extra in the evening (and sometimes in the morning as well) to complete all of the playtimes for dogs coming in later in the day. Saturdays and Sundays don’t usually need an extra person as we open later and close earlier Keep in mind things going on at the high school such as prom, sports seasons, etc. and plan ahead. Be fair when scheduling: Everyone needs to work holidays. If they request a holiday off, make sure they have or are on for other holidays. High school students should each have the same number of shifts if possible. Try to keep schedules the same from week to week if possible. If you need to put someone on for a day they usually don’t work, ask first. Everyone works weekends. If someone is not available to work weekends on a regular basis, they may be taken off the schedule all together."

Safety comes 1st to ensure pets are happy and healthy when staying with us! Always treat pets with the utmost respect and care. Always keep in mind customer perception, there may be a tour walking through. You should ALWAYS be kind and respectful to all animals in our care. Never raise your voice towards a pet, unless it is absolutely necessary to keep them safe. NEVER put your face near a pet's mouth. If a pet is \"experienced staff only\" (it will say this on the run card, and in the notes) do not handle them unless granted permission from a supervisor or manager. As outlined in PackPro, keep the leash high up on the dog's neck, keep a short leash, walking the dog to the left of you, and using BOTH HANDS on the leash to maintain control. Do not let dogs interact when on the leash, as some dogs can be unexpectedly reactive on a leash. No handling dogs if you are the only person in the building. Do not take pets through the lobby when bringing them to their suite. Never leave animals from different families unattended. If there is anything unusual about a pet, read their notes, make a new note if necessary, and/or reach out to a supervisor or manager for assistance. Poop should be picked up as soon as you see it, even if it is not from your dog. Discourage indoor elimination. Watch for signs they need to go (sniffing, etc.) let them out before they go inside. See \"Managing Group Play Sessions\", \"Individual / Custom Playtimes\", \"Completing Eliminations and Walks\", and \"Performing a Wellness Check\" for more relevant information."

    "content": "Signs of Bloat Bloat Wellness Training Bloat is a very serious health risk for dogs. Bloating of a dog’s stomach is usually related to swallowed air (although food and fluid can be present). It usually happens when there is an abnormal accumulation of air, fluid, and/or foam in the stomach. Stress can be a significant contributing factor as well. As the stomach swells, it can rotate, causing the fixed attachments between the esophagus and upper intestine to twist. The twisting stomach traps air, food, and water in the stomach. The bloated stomach obstructs veins in the abdomen, leading to low blood pressure, shock, and damage to internal organs. This combined effect can lead to the death of a dog. Most Common Symptoms of Bloat: Attempts to vomit unsuccessfully, every 5-30 minutes. This is one of the most common signs Frequently “asking” to go outside to eliminate, significantly more often than normal Significant anxiety or restlessness “Hunched up” or “roached up” appearance Bloated abdomen that feels tight (like a drum) Potential Causes of Bloat High degree of stress Activities that result in gulping a large amount of air Food bowl elevated too high Rapid eating Eating fatty food(s) Drinking too much water too quickly Heredity Too much exercise before and especially after eating Disposition to bloat due to breed, heredity, temperament, or other contributing factors If you see any signs or signals that cause you to be concerned that a dog is experiencing bloat, retrieve a bottle of Gas-X from the meds cabinet. Give the dog 1 tablespoon of the gas-reducing medicine. Immediately call the manager or owner that is scheduled to be “on call” for emergencies to determine if and how the dog will be transported to a veterinarian."

    "content": "Acute Colitis in Dogs What You Need to Know About Acute Colitis Reference Material What is colitis? Colitis is a medical term that simply means inflammation of the colon. In dogs, this most commonly results in loose stool or diarrhea that may have mucus or fresh (red) blood. Affected dogs will usually defecate more frequently, and may strain as they defecate, or even attempt to defecate without producing any stool. Sometimes colitis is mistaken for constipation when dogs are straining but not defecating. Colitis may be chronic (lasting several days or weeks, or recurrent) or acute (sudden onset with a short duration). What causes acute colitis? Colitis is a common disease in dogs that can be caused by several factors. Excitement and stress are factors when it comes to acute colitis being observed in a pet care facility. Traveling, new situations and settings and being around new dogs are all contributors to canines. Another source of acute colitis is diet, whether it's a sudden change in food, water, overeating, or raiding the garbage. Acute colitis can also be brought on by parasitic infections. It typically takes several days to weeks from the time of contact for diarrhea to occur. Bacterial and viral infections can also be a cause, though less likely. How can you tell if a dog is affected? A dog with acute colitis typically has a good appetite, normal energy, and does not lose weight. Certain breeds including German Shepherds, Labrador retrievers, Irish Setters, Yorkshire terriers and miniature Schnauzers, among others, as well as nervous or excitable individual dogs, can be predisposed to developing diarrhea. Additionally, dogs have been with their owners for an extended period (as during COVID) may be more susceptible to colitis. In a pet care facility environment, it's important to identify individuals who may be at higher risk if they develop diarrhea. These include young puppies and kittens, debilitated pets or those with chronic medical conditions, very old pets, and very small dogs with profuse diarrhea. Other concerning factors include the presence of dark, tar-like stool, stool that looks like \"raspberry jam,\" or a pet that is lethargic or declining. Any of these factors individually or in combination should be triggers to seek veterinary advice. How to manage acute colitis Fortunately, most cases of acute colitis resolve quickly with treatment. • Begin an immediate fast for 24-48 hours and keep water available. • Administer an over-the-counter supplement for diarrhea, such as Diagel or Pro-pectalin, every 12 hours for 1-3 doses. • Break the fast with a highly digestible diet formulated with a small amount of fermentable fiber, fed as small meals more frequently. Canned foods like Hills ID, Royal Canin GI, or Purina EN are good choices. • A typical regimen for a 50-pound dog (after fasting 24+ hours) would be 1/4 cup bland diet for the first meal followed by 1/4 cup of bland diet three times daily for the next 24 hours, then 1/4 cup of bland diet plus 1/4 cup of their typical diet twice daily for the next 24 hours, then a return to normal meals. • Probiotics such as Synacore, FortiFlora, and Proviable DC can be added to the food once or twice daily according to body weight for 3-5 days to help resolve diarrhea. • Early studies are looking at a possible role of polyphenols (like rutin, quercetin, and resveratrol) as beneficial supplements to heal the inflamed colon. • Stressed or nervous dogs may benefit from an over-the-counter anti-anxiety supplement, given with their guardian's permission, as either a diarrhea preventative or an addition once the diarrhea has resolved. These include CBD products, L-theanine, colostrum, hydrolyzed milk proteins, herbal formulas, and rescue remedy (applied directly to the inner eat or drops put in drinking water). Unfortunately, many of these products take several days to weeks of administration to produce a calming effect. • Young dogs with acute colitis should be evaluated for parasites and their veterinary record should be checked to determine the date of their most recent fecal exam and/or de-worming. Once a pet is back on a regular diet, the amount of food and the addition of any treats should be carefully evaluated. Pet parents often instruct lodging facilities to feed their pets more than they eat at home, either from concern that they don't want their pets to be hungry, or sometimes from a lack of knowledge of how much their dog or cat actually eats. A pet that overeats for a day or two will often develop diarrhea simply from the excessive amount of food being fed. How long will it take for affected dogs to return to normal? Typical acute colitis should resolve in 1-3 days. If a dog continues to have diarrhea that is not resolving, or if the diarrhea is worsening, veterinary care should be obtained. Sometimes a pet will have diarrhea upon returning home, even though the stools were completely normal while lodging. This can happen with a diet change, with the excitement of seeing their \"people\" again, or with over-zealous feeding of treats after being reunited. A fast of 12-24 hours, followed by small meals of a highly digestible food, usually is sufficient to resolve these situations."

At Paws we pride ourselves with offering the best care for our pet parents and their four-legged family members. A high standard and quality of play is required during these activities. The following are guidelines for appropriate behavior while conducting an individual playtime. If the dog is scheduled to depart early we do their playtime before the others. If a dog has multiple play times we try to space them out as much as possible, within reason. Do custom plays outside so the dog can get exercise. In the event of inclement weather (freezing, icy, thunderstorm) you may bring the dog outside to do their business then return to their suite, playgym, or lux hallway (if empty) to play with them. Start a timer for 15 minutes and record the time the playtime is started. Focus on the dog during the play time! Try to get the dog excited and playful if possible. If the dog does not want to play with you, you can pet them, talk to them, and/or walk around with them. Our guests deserve your undivided attention for a full 15 minutes. Observe the dog during your time with them, completing a wellness check. If there is food in their bowls, try hand feeding them to encourage them to finish. If you note there are any activities the dog especially loves doing, such as chasing a ball, belly rubs, or cuddling, write a note on their room cards and let the front desk know so they can make a note of it. Keep track of the pet using the bathroom, and record it on their room card once you bring them in. When you are done with the play time return the dog to their suite. Top off their water and remove empty bowls. Make note on their room card if they went to the bathroom or finished their food. At the end of your shift, fill out the Playlist with your times and tell shift lead/supervisor if a dog hasn't come in, left early, etc."

    "content": "Pack Pro Training Reminders Pack Pro Training Reminders Operating Policies New employees of Paws Pet Resort & Spa are provided access to PackPro's full video training curriculum and associated workbook. Key points of that education program are summarized below. Key Terms: DAYCARE: Daycare is a group of dogs socializing off leash, under the supervision of a handler. It is a privilege for well behaved, socially appropriate dogs . Daycare is an environment for social dogs to gather and play. Group daycare IS NOT an environment for unsocialized or aggressive dogs to learn appropriate social skills. NEUTRAL ZONE: An area in daycare that the handler determines temporarily or permanently dogs will not enter. DESENSITIZING: To prevent an emotional response in a dog (such as fear, anxiety, nervousness) to a training tool or training concept. Desensitization is the process of exposing the animal to a stimulus beginning at a very low intensity. LURING: Luring is when you guide your dog by holding a treat in front of their nose. The most effective way to use luring is to use the food lure to steer the dog into the desired position for the first few attempts, then transition the luring motion into a hand signal, and then add a verbal cue. COUNTER CONDITIONING: The conditioning of an unwanted behavior or response to a stimulus into a wanted behavior or response by the association of positive actions with the stimulus. Counter conditioning and desensitization need to be used together to be effective and are often used to change unwanted behavior in dogs. OVERSTIMULATION: Overstimulation is when a dog is mentally stimulated excessively, causing clouded thinking and behavior that the dog would ordinarily not do. Dogs that enter an overstimulated state of mind can make dangerous decisions in a group of dogs. It’s also very challenging for a dog to learn anything while they are in this state of mind. It can create behaviors such as: Spinning in circles Running around uncontrollably Being easily distracted Excessive panting (but it’s not that hot) Chewing unusual items Nipping or biting Jumping, leaping or lunging Barking and snarling. Key Skills You Must Execute to Properly Manage Group Play: Entering Play Group - stand tall and walk confidently. Body Blocking - DON'T: Use your hands to push dogs Move quickly Swing or kick your legs towards any dog Get frustrated or emotional Use correct Verbal Commands with Hand Signals Sit Down Off Out Come Here Wait Place That's Enough Use correct Tools in the proper manner Slip Leads Head Halter Slip Lead Kibble Treats Crates Prevent Fights through: Properly managing how dogs enter a pack of dogs Proper behavior corrections Preventing Over Arousal during play Teaching dogs basic skills Basic recall Group Sit Wait at the gate Stay out of my bubble Moving Groups Managing Unwanted Behaviors Identifying Proper Communication with other team members"

Marking Up the Playlist and Creating Lists for Team Members Assigning Play Sessions: Print the activity schedule and the day care report for the day. This must be done by 9:00AM. Using different colored markers, assign the groups. Using 4 separate colors, assign dogs to Big Dog/Small Dog groups Write lists with dogs names and room numbers for each group to hand out to staff at each group time. If a dog is coming in late and doesn't make it into their group play, we will do a custom play time instead. Put a yellow dot next to their name. Assigning Individual (Custom) Play Sessions: Using a yellow marker, make a dot next to all of the dogs that will have a custom play time. If a dog is scheduled to leave in the morning, make a note to do their playtime first. Notes and Exceptions for Assigning Play Sessions: Having a larger big dog group in the morning will often make the second group more manageable Dogs leaving today should go to the first group of their size Dogs arriving today should go to the last group of their size"

    "content": "Group Playtimes Group Playtimes Operating Procedure Before beginning any playgroup sessions: If Group is indoors; Make a clean mop bucket (256) with a new mop head and put it in one of the 3 rooms in the playgym. Get three water bowls for each play group (usually 12 total), fill with water, and place over the drain in the play room or outside. Water bowls must be switched out or cleaned with each play group. Ensure foldable fences are set up around the doors to ensure there is a double layer of entry, making it easier to bring dogs in and out of the group. Inspect areas for unsafe conditions, broken fence, gates, choking hazards, as well as any toys, food, etc. Start the Play School session outside in the yards to allow everyone to do their business. If the weather permits, they can remain outside on the green, otherwise move inside. During playgroup sessions: Follow the methods and strategies used by PackPro - see \"Managing Group Play Sessions\" procedure. Rinse and refill all water bowls every half hour to keep them fresh and clean Pick up any stools as soon as possible (ensure any contact with other dogs is prevented) Mop areas that were picked up (wring mop to remove excess water) Mop all urine as soon as possible so no dogs can track it around or step in it Keep the floor as dry as possible to avoid slipping. Using a squeegee is helpful! Make note of any incident in the incidents section of the client record of all dogs involved. Do not let dogs chew on things they shouldn’t, eat rocks, etc. After playgroup sessions: When bringing in dogs from playgroup, follow the ID collars of the boarding dogs, and either print out the daycare list or search where the dogs are using Gingr on your cell phone’s browser. Empty water bowls, bring to kitchen and wash them Empty scooper and wash off Bring mop bucket to laundry room, empty and rinse bucket, put mop head in washer Make sure all daycare dogs have water in their bedrooms when you are putting them back. If they have empty bowls, remove them now and mark the cards. Cleaning the Yards after Sessions: Sanitize with 256 both indoors & all outside yards – this should be done every day. Patios with concrete should not be cleaned during freezing temps. Empty the poop buckets from the play gym or greenyard and empty and refill scoop water buckets with foamer. Windex windows and clean off window sills and any surface that may collect dust or dirt. Clean out the gym drain bucket Monday & Thursday (twice per week)."

Open the Guest's profile in Gingr. Remove the group play icon, and assign the individual play icon on their account. Make a note (or incident report if serious) on the animal's profile about exactly what behavior was observed, and why the dog is no longer suitable for group play. Notify the Front Desk staff to change all future activities on the dog's reservation to individual play. Also ask the Front Desk to check to see if the dog has any future reservations scheduled. If so the activities for all future reservations should also be modified. Front desk or supervisor must call the client to inform the client in a non-alarming manner. After confirming the future activities on the dog's reservation have been changed to individual play, write on the pet's run card to ensure they are not taken out to group again."

    "content": "Evaluating Dogs for Group Play Evaluations Evaluating Dogs for Group Play (Evaluations) Operating Procedure If a pet parent wants their dog to play with other dogs, we will start by conducting an evaluation to be sure he or she will enjoy the group play experience. Only staff trained for Group Play should conduct evaluations. Take the dog out to the play yard and spend a few minutes getting to know the dog, letting the dog explore the play yard and get comfortable with his surroundings and you. If and when the dog seems comfortable and relaxed, introduce another dog with calm temperament and of similar size. Let them first meet through the gate then on a leash. If all goes well you can let them off the leash to interact. Supervise closely, watching for any signs of aggression or fear. If all goes well, bring out another dog that might be a little more playful than the first and see how they interact. If everyone is getting along and showing no signs of fear or aggression, you can slowly introduce the dog to the rest of the group. Notes must be made in the new dog’s client file regarding who did the evaluation, what dogs it was done with and how they did during the evaluation and during group play. Additional notes can be made as the dog progresses and feels more comfortable. Add a 'B', 'M', 'S', or 'I' icon to their Gingr file for future reference of what playtime they belong to. As part of a pet's first day, a midday call to the owner must be made and the rest of the first day checklist must be completed. Click here to view the first day checklist."

    "content": "Managing Group Play Sessions Managing Group Play Sessions Operating Procedure Group play can be a great way for dogs to become socialized in a pack environment. However, it’s not for all dogs, which is why as an activities team member you will be tasked with monitoring and managing these group play sessions, ensuring all dogs are safely playing. It is important to establish your leadership role and maintain a safe and playful environment. The following are guidelines for effectively interacting with the pack while conducting a play session. Leadership Productive pack management starts with great leadership, which can be established in many ways. The following are some appropriate and effective ways to do so. Appropriate ways to establish a leadership role: When in play groups, a six-foot leash needs to be carried by the group leader at all times. This tool can be used to establish a bond with any dog in the play yard through leash work. It can be especially effective with members of the pack that display excessive energy and/or a lack of boundaries with the other pack members. Presenting yourself as the “alpha” to the pack is key to ensuring a safe and well-managed play group. Things like establishing eye contact and body posture (i.e., standing tall with an outward chest) project confidence and are great ways to achieve this presence. The following are ways to interact with the pack and it all starts when entering into the play yard. When walking into a play yard, ignore the pack members rushing toward you. To prevent dogs from jumping at your body, it is ok to slowly lift a knee in an upward motion to deter jumping at you. During this process, keep a calm composure and walk a couple laps around the field. If a dog nips at your fingers for attention and/or tries to get your attention by nudging at your hands, cross your arms just under your chest to help deter it. Walking the yard throughout the day in this manner projects confidence to the pack. It is important to constantly be moving and scanning the yard for high-energy dogs that you can interact with, while instilling your leadership. Gate management is key to keeping the dogs safe during the loading and unloading process of groups. It is also a great way to establish a boundary with the pack and display leadership. Gate management is done by positioning yourself in front of the gate entry/exit point. You will need to establish a three-foot boundary between you and the pack. This can be done using the command “wait.” You can also slowly lean your knee forward toward the dog(s). You do this by placing your right or left foot on the ground three feet in front of you and leaning your knee toward the pack. Repeat this until you have successfully established the three-foot space. Novice activity leads can remain in front of the pack, establishing eye contact with pack members. You can also use the command “sit” and/or “wait” to establish more leadership/authority (when using verbal commands it’s important to not overly communicate, allow at least five second pauses between each command.) Intermediate activity leads can establish themselves in front of the gate with it partially open with your body still in position to block the area. Advanced activity leads can practice with the gate fully open, your body at the gates side not blocking the entry/exit. “Group sit” is another great activity to practice with the pack. Find an area of the yard where you can gain the attention of the surrounding dogs. Using hand signals and the command “sit,” see how many in the area will respond to the command. Continue to practice this throughout the day. Novice activity leads have the surrounding dogs sit for a minimum of two seconds. Intermediate activity leads have the surrounding dogs sit for three seconds Advanced sit for four seconds. “Follow the Leader.” This is a great way to distract when dogs are fixating on a particular area or dogs. It is also a great way to establish a leadership role by redirecting the pack to follow your lead. During this activity, repeat the command “let’s go” one to three times in an energized and elevated tone while walking to the opposite end of the yard. Most pack members will fall in behind you; however, if they do not, continue to practice this throughout the day."
