      <h1><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;">Providing Excellent Customer Service</span></span></strong></span></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;">Operating Procedure</span></strong></span></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;">Our customers are why we are here. Every customer should be listened to and valued in order to feel good about leaving their pets here with us.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;">We are honored that they entrust us with their most beloved pets, and it is our duty to provide nothing but the best customer service.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">First Impression Matters</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Please ensure the lobby is in excellent condition. Making sure it smells good, free of hair/debris on the floor, and is organized are key to a great first impression.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">In order to portray a professional appearance, we value having the front desk staff wearing&nbsp;collared shirts and a genuine smile. The front desk staff should be as neat as possible and on the conservative side, i.e. no excessive piercings, gum chewing, etc. Our objective is to present ourselves as being organized, caring, courteous, professional, and trustworthy - our customers deserve our best!&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Greeting Customers</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">As soon as a customer walks in, you must halt what you are doing, and greet the customer. Even if you are handling another task, you must still acknowledge the customer and let them know you will be with them shortly.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">All staff will greet every customer they encounter with a big smile and a friendly, genuine, enthusiastic greeting. If their dog is present, greet the dog as well. Greet the dog by name if possible and say something nice about the dog.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">If there is a client in the lobby and you are unsure if they are being taken care of, always ask if they are being assisted.</span></span></li>
	<li><font face="Work Sans"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Check in and out pets as fast as possible, while maintaining accuracy. We don&#39;t want our customers to wait in the lobby for a long time.</span></font></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Use caution with what you say if there are customers in the lobby. Even if you think they can&#39;t hear you, they may be able to.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Importance of&nbsp;a &#39;Paws&#39;-itive attitude</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">No matter how busy it is,</span></span><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;"> it is important to portray to our customers that we have things under control. We do not want them to &quot;see us sweat.&quot;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Everyone at Paws must come to work with a &#39;paws&#39;-itive attitude each and every day. A negative attitude can spread among coworkers and very quickly lead to a negative work environment. The pets deserve our best performance, and a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude is necessary to provide excellent care no matter the circumstance.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Regardless of personal feelings or challenges, we commit to setting aside any distractions at the door and dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to delivering the best possible experience for both the animals and customers in our care every single day.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Unconditional Listening</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">We must always listen to our customers, even if we think they are wrong. Remember, &quot;the customer is always right!&quot;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Work Sans, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">If a customer takes the time to tell us something, it is clearly something they are concerned about so much that they thought they would let us know. They are providing us with valuable feedback, and it is imperative to unconditionally listen and try to help as best you can!&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><font face="Work Sans"><span style="font-size: 16px;">NEVER argue with a customer. Instead, listen attentively and genuinely try to understand what they are saying. If you deem what they are saying is incorrect, instead of using the words &quot;you&#39;re wrong,&quot; say &quot;actually,...&quot; and proceed to describe the truth.&nbsp;</span></font></li>
	<li><font face="Work Sans"><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you are uncomfortable speaking with a customer, ask for a supervisor or manager.</span></font></li>
