<p><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color:#2980b9;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><span>What is colitis?</span></span></span></strong></span></small></big></span></samp><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color:#2980b9;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;"> </span></span></span></strong></span></small></big></span></samp></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Colitis is a medical term that simply means inflammation of the colon. In dogs, this most commonly results in loose stool or diarrhea that may have mucus or fresh (red) blood. Affected dogs will usually defecate more frequently, and may strain as they defecate, or even attempt to defecate without producing any stool. Sometimes colitis is mistaken for constipation when dogs are straining but not defecating. Colitis may be chronic (lasting several days or weeks, or recurrent) or acute (sudden onset with a short duration). </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#2980b9;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">What causes acute colitis? </span></small></big></span></samp></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Colitis is a common disease in dogs that can be caused by several factors. Excitement and stress are factors when it comes to acute colitis being observed in a pet care facility. Traveling, new situations and settings and being around new dogs are all contributors to canines. Another source of acute colitis is diet, whether it&#39;s a sudden change in food, water, overeating, or raiding the garbage. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Acute colitis can also be brought on by parasitic infections. It typically takes several days to weeks from the time of contact for diarrhea to occur. Bacterial and viral infections can also be a cause, though less likely. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#2980b9;"><strong><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">How can you tell if a dog is affected? </span></small></big></span></samp></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">A dog with acute colitis typically has a good appetite, normal energy, and does not lose weight. Certain breeds including German Shepherds, Labrador retrievers, Irish Setters, Yorkshire terriers and miniature Schnauzers, among others, as well as nervous or excitable individual dogs, can be predisposed to developing diarrhea. Additionally, dogs have been with their owners for an extended period (as during COVID) may be more susceptible to colitis.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">In a pet care facility environment, it&#39;s important to identify individuals who may be at higher risk if they develop diarrhea. These include young puppies and kittens, debilitated pets or those with chronic medical conditions, very old pets, and very small dogs with profuse diarrhea. Other concerning factors include the presence of dark, tar-like stool, stool that looks like &quot;raspberry jam,&quot; or a pet that is lethargic or declining. Any of these factors individually or in combination should be triggers to seek veterinary advice.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color:#2980b9;"><span style="font-size:20px;">How to manage acute colitis</span></span></strong></span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Fortunately, most cases of acute colitis resolve quickly with treatment.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Begin an immediate fast for 24-48 hours and keep water available. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Administer an over-the-counter supplement for diarrhea, such as Diagel or Pro-pectalin, every 12 hours for 1-3 doses.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Break the fast with a highly digestible diet formulated with a small amount of fermentable fiber, fed as small meals more frequently. Canned foods like Hills ID, Royal Canin GI, or Purina EN are good choices. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; A typical regimen for a 50-pound dog (after fasting 24+ hours) would be 1/4 cup bland diet for the first meal followed by 1/4 cup of bland diet three times daily for the next 24 hours, then 1/4 cup of bland diet plus 1/4 cup of their typical diet twice daily for the next 24 hours, then a return to normal meals. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Probiotics such as Synacore, FortiFlora, and Proviable DC can be added to the food once or twice daily according to body weight for 3-5 days to help resolve diarrhea. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Early studies are looking at a possible role of polyphenols (like rutin, quercetin, and resveratrol) as beneficial supplements to heal the inflamed colon.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Stressed or nervous dogs may benefit from an over-the-counter anti-anxiety supplement, given with their guardian&#39;s permission, as either a diarrhea preventative or an addition once the diarrhea has resolved. These include CBD products, L-theanine, colostrum, hydrolyzed milk proteins, herbal formulas, and rescue remedy (applied directly to the inner eat or drops put in drinking water). Unfortunately, many of these products take several days to weeks of administration to produce a calming effect.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">&bull; Young dogs with acute colitis should be evaluated for parasites and their veterinary record should be checked to determine the date of their most recent fecal exam and/or de-worming. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Once a pet is back on a regular diet, the amount of food and the addition of any treats should be carefully evaluated. Pet parents often instruct lodging facilities to feed their pets more than they eat at home, either from concern that they don&#39;t want their pets to be hungry, or sometimes from a lack of knowledge of how much their dog or cat actually eats. A pet that overeats for a day or two will often develop diarrhea simply from the excessive amount of food being fed. </span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="color:#2980b9;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">How long will it take for affected dogs to return to normal? </span></small></big></span></samp></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><samp><span dir="ltr"><big><small><span style="font-family: Inter, sans-serif;">Typical acute colitis should resolve in 1-3 days. If a dog continues to have diarrhea that is not resolving, or if the diarrhea is worsening, veterinary care should be obtained. Sometimes a pet will have diarrhea upon returning home, even though the stools were completely normal while lodging. This can happen with a diet change, with the excitement of seeing their &quot;people&quot; again, or with over-zealous feeding of treats after being reunited. A fast of 12-24 hours, followed by small meals of a highly digestible food, usually is sufficient to resolve these situations.</span></small></big></span></samp></span></p>
